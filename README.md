## Motivation
After having Spotify play the same 40-50 songs repetitively from my playlist that's well over 1000 songs in total, I was done with their shuffle algorithm. TrueShuffle is a completely front-end based web application that interacts with the Spotify API to bring truly unbiased music shuffling to Spotify. This application currently only works with Spotify accounts that have premium as the Playback API only works for accounts with Spotify's premium service.

## How to use?
- Go to https://shuffle.software/
- Connect your Spotify Account
- Choose your desired playlist & device to begin playback
- That's it, after retrieving your playlist's songs for the first time, truly shuffled music should start playing automatically.
